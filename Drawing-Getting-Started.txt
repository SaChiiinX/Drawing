Getting Started on the Drawing Project


Part 1: Drawing lines with rubber banding. 

a. Go to the installUnderRoot method. Since you won't be using
   transformations at first, you should comment out the comment out
   the first two lines, and replace them with:
       
   TransformNode* newXfn = new TransformNode(sceneRoot, newShape, NULL);
          
b. Open scene.h and find the Line class declaration. In the private
   section, declare four double variables (x0, y0, x1, y1) to hold
   the four double constructor parameters.  Now open scene.cpp and
   find the Line class constructor. The constructor already
   includes a call to its base class (ShapeNode) constructor to
   initialize the inherited color variable. Finish the constructor
   by replacing :ShapeNode(c) with

      :ShapeNode(c), x0(xx0), y0(yy0), x1(xx1), y1(yy1)

   c. Return to scene.h and declare a variable color of type colorType in
   the protected section of the ShapeNode class. Next find the
   ShapeNode constructor in scene.cpp and add code to initialize
   the color variable. 
      
d. Now go to the Line::draw() implementation in scene.cpp. Add the
   statement setColor(color) to set the color. Then open graphics.h
   and find the drawLine declaration that takes four doubles. Go
   back to scene.cpp and implement Line::draw using this graphics
   function.

e. Now go to graphics.cpp and implement the four-parameter drawLine
   function calls to OpenGL. Test your program by drawing lines. You
   should see rubber bands, but the completed line is not yet drawn.

f. Return to scene.h and find the TransformNode declaration.
   Declare TransformNode* parent in the private section. Declare
   ShapeNode* shapeNode in the protected section of the class
   declaration. Find the two TransformNode constructors in
   Scene.cpp. Add code to initialize parent and shapeNode in both
   constructors.
